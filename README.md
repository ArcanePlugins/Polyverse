# Polyverse

A powerful, robust and libre world management plugin for SpigotMC/PaperMC servers.

## What is this?

I would like to provide a proper alternative to the Multiverse plugin suite, which has long called for a replacement.

## Don't you already have one?

I have a world management plugin [PhantomWorlds](https://github.com/lokka30/PhantomWorlds), though PW is a barebones plugin, which was not designed to have features such as per-world inventories, portals, GUIs and so on. It was thus never marketed as a Multiverse replacement, though, did function as such for a good handful of servers.

## Where is it?

It's currently an idea with zero code. I would like to brainstorm things before I get started on the code to avoid rewriting things (which I usually do multiple times before I'm happy with a plugin release nowadays).

## May I be involved?

Please be. If you're unsure where to start, just ask in the Discussions tab and we can give you some pointers. Suggestions, feedback, testing, code, and so on are much appreciated.

## Plugins have tried this in the past but failed, how is this different?

We don't care what plugins you use. If this plugin's adoption is relatively small, that's fine, at least there are server owners enjoying the software. :)

To try write a good world manager, we'll try reflect on what works and what doesn't work on other plugins, brainstorm a design that likely ticks most people's boxes and give it a beta-test run before we'll mark the project as released.
